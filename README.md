## Summary
It provides a way to solve google [kick-start competition](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) problems with Javascript.
- Reading data synchronously from console
- Printing results
- Abstract interface to solve data-structure problems

## Motivation
It is realy hard to attend in this coding competition with Javacript. Main problem is reading data from node.js console happens asynchronously, so to solve a simple problem, competitor needs to deal with a complex async/callback pattern to just read the data. \

Despite the competition is not about performance but this problem push most competitors toward low-level languages like C++. However, I believe if these non-relevant problem fixed, taking advantage of a rich high-level language like Javascript can potentially leed to a winning strategy.
