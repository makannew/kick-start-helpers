## Summary
It provides a way to solve google [kick-start competition](https://codingcompetitions.withgoogle.com/kickstart) problems with Javascript.
- Reading data synchronously from console
- Printing results
- Abstract interface to solve data-structure problems

## How to use
* Copy/paste content of [index.js](https://github.com/makannew/kick-start-helpers/blob/master/src/index.js) in the code window
* Copy/paste content of [boilerplate.js](https://github.com/makannew/kick-start-helpers/blob/master/src/boilerplate.js) in the code window
* Write your code inside the provided `for` loop

## Goal
My main goal is building few functions to solve data-structure problems in an abstract way close to human thinking pattern. Then If it is possible to solve all past competition problems through these functions I can conclude that they will useful for comming problems as well. These functions should have some features to be more effective:
- Fewer number of functions
- Easy to remember and use
- No overlap or redundant
- Use consistent interface
- Cover wide range of proplems
- Collaborate and combine together to become more powerfull and thorough

## Motivation
It is realy hard to attend in this coding competition with Javacript. Main problem is reading data from node.js console happens asynchronously, so to solve a simple problem, competitor needs to deal with a complex async/callback pattern to just read the data. 

Despite the competition is not about performance but this problem push most competitors toward low-level languages like C++. However, I believe if these non-relevant problem fixed, taking advantage of a rich high-level language like Javascript can potentially leed to a winning strategy.
